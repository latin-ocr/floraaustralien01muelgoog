Calyx deeply divided into 5 segmenta. Corolla with a eylimlrical tabe,
the tlrroat with 5 minute gibbosities or sarles or quite uuhed, the lirnb
spreading‚ b-lobed. Stamens inserted in the tube, the authors iucluded.
Orary 4-lobed; style frliform, inserted between the lobes, with a small
usually capitata stigma. Nuts 4, rugose or reticulate, ercet, attached lo the
shortly pyramidal or convex receptaele by an obliquo areole, the iuuer angle
prominent. Seeds without albumen; radicle short.-Herbs with the habit
foliage and flowers nearly of Myosofia, bnt the infloresoenoe usually with brnots.

There is a considerable nrrmber of speeies dispersed over the tem te aud monataiuons
regions of Europe and Asia, and iu Ameriae deseending from the 'uited States along the
liae of the Andes to Chilo. The only Australian one is eudemio. lhe genus is closely
allied to dfyoaotir aud Echinorpermurn, haring the same babit aud dowers, with the fruit
intermediae, as it were, between the two, the receptaele more promineat thau iu dfyorolr'a,

much less so than iu Echinoapermum, the uuts neither smooth aud sbiuiug aa iu tbe former
uor urnrieate as in the latter.

rarely exeeeding ξ in., the upper ones smaller. flowers very small (whitel),
nearly sessile in the arils of the braets, forming simple oue-sided leafy spikoe.
Calyx-segments very hispid, linear, scarcely 1 line long. Corolla searoely
