Although 1 had originally considered this genna tn bc the trae Aderorma olBrorrn,1
uas subsequently misled by sorne specimens sent to me by A. Cunningham, as haring been
identified with the Bnnlrsiau plant, sad which proved to be inseparablelrom Stemodic. 'l'be
eramirratiom however, which l have norr made ot Brown's and Bunhs’r typical sper-imens,
shows that they belong ln lact to my Plerortiyara callosum, and that Cnnuingham’s plant
is very different, both in station and in character. The name ol Adeaorraa must, therefore,
be now given to the rrhole el my gertus Pterortr'yara.

6. asamona, Linn.

Calyx dirided to the base into ὅ segments or aspele, all equal or the upper
one scarcely larger. Corolia tubular at the base, the upper lip broad, entire
or notched, the lower oue spreading, 3-lobed. Stamene 4, in pairs; anthers
2-cclled with the cells quite separate, usually stipitate. Style dilated at the
summit into 2 stigmatis lobes or rarely entire, not winged. Capsule globu-
lar, ovate or scammate, opening septieidally in 2 usually aad salves or in t
salves, the placentas ol' the two carpels completely separating at maturity (at
least in the Aristralian sectioa). Seeds numerous, small, striata and usually
reticulate—Herbs, rarely uuderrhrnhr, more or less glandular-pubescent or
villous aad oiten strong-scented. Leaves opposite or in whorls ol 3 or t.
Flowers solitary in the axils, the upper ones osten forming terminal spilres.
Braeteoles usually 2, linear, close under the calyx.
