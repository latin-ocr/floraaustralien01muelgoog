Calyx·tnbe hemispherieal turbinato ovoid oblong or rurely linear, limb of
blobes‚ open or reduplicatum-valvatae in the bnd. Corolia alit open ou the
upper side to the baso, blobed, the 2 npper lobes usually sbortm, more doeply
separated and ereet or eurved upwerds‚ forming a more or less distinct upper
lip, the 3 lower spreeding in a lower 3·lobed lip. Stamene inserted at the
baseos the eorolla, sometimes very shortly udnute to it, the filaments often
united above the middle; authors united in an oblique or slightly ineurved
ring round the style. Ovary 2-eelled. Stigma broedly 2-lobed and osten
surrounded by a ring ol retractile heire. Capsule opening looulicidally
within the calyx-lobes in 2 volves, rarely splitting also longitudinally below
the calyx-lobes when old-Herba, often aorid with a milky juiee, the Aus-
tralian ones either annual or ereeping und rooting at the base. Pedieels l·
boasted, either exillury or terminol or in terminal raeemes, sometimes bearing
2 small bracteoles‚ which are never constant in tho seme speeies. Flowers
in a lew speeies dioeoious by the abortion or sterility of the anthers in the
immoles, and the imperiection oi the undivided stigma and abortion ol the
ov es in the meles.
