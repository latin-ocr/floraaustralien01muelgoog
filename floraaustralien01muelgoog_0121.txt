49. S. sustentata, Bentt. in Huey. Eoum. 68. An erect shmb ol 2
or 3 lt, nearly glabrous except some long woolly hnirs at thebasa ol the
leaves. Branches virgate. Leaves linear almost setnoeous clustered nt the
andes, from 2 to 4 lines or rarely l in. long, the upper and lloral ones similar
but less clustered. Flowcrs small, numerous, sessile in the upper axils,
forming a terminal lealy spilre. Bructeolcs linear, usually unaqual. Calyx-
lobes linear, as longas the s-nboed tube. Corolla about 4 lines long,
white, osten with darlr spots in the throat‚ glabrous outside, the lobes about
as longas the tube, their margins induplicate bnt not so distinctly winged as
in most species. Ovary l·celled, witha single ovule, the convex summit
shortly srec within the corolla. Style covered avith short darlr glandulas
hairs. Fruit ovoid‚ 1 to l} lines long, rather more than half inferint—DC.

50. S. stenophylla, Bentl. An crcot glabrnus shrnb with numerous
virgata branchos. Leaves rather crowded but not clustered‚ very narrosv
linear, almost terete, l to l in. long or sometimes more, quite entire, the
lloral ones reduced to short bracts, all but the lower ones scarcely cxceeding ’
the calyx. Flowers numerous, sessile or nearly so in terminnl spilres.
Bracteoles very small. calyx-tube scarcely l line long, the lobes oblong,
crect. Corolia glabrous outside, about 5 lines long, the entire part much
shorter than the lobes, thc adnale part of the tube with a slight concavo
protuberancc on the lower side. Ovavy l·celled, with 2 ovules, the very
convcx summit free within the corolla. Style hispid with short purple glan-
dular hairs. Indusium very deep, not ciliatc. Fruit ovoid‚l to l} lines
long, rather more than hall inferior. Sceds l or 2, oval-oblong, more or less
flattened, especially when both ripemunt bordered.-Goodenia theophylus,

calyx-tube adnata, limbos t distinct segments. Corolia oblique, the tube
entire, the lobes nearly equid, spreading. Stamene free, entirely included as
vell as the style in the tube of the corolla. Indusium cup-shaped‚ entire.
Ovnry wholly inferior, l·celled, with 2 erect ovulcs. Frnit small, ovoid, dry
or nearly so, but indehiscent. Seeds of Scaevola-Hem with linear leaves.
Flovers axillam, peduaculate‚ solitary between 2 bracteoles.

'l'he genus is limited to n single specics, eudemio in Arntrnlin, closely allicd to mesola,
dillering in the nearly regular corolla enclosing tho genitalis in its tube.
