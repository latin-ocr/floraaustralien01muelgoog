Calyx·tuhe free hut contracted over tlte ovary; lobes 5. Corolia nearly
regular, inserted nt the base of the calyx-tube, the tube cylindrical5 lobes 5,
salvate, spreading, the 2 upper oncs separated rather lower down. Stamene
5, inserted at the base of the corolla-tube, the filaments cohering upwards,
the anthera cohering in aring round the style. Ovary free, hut enclosed in
the calyx-tube, l·eelled, with a single erect anatropons ovule. Style simple;
stigma shortly trohen, enclosed ina cup-shaped indusium. Fruit a small
nut enclosed in the hardened calyx-tube. Seed creet, without albumen.
Embryo straight, cotyledone ovate, radicle short, inlation-Silky-hniry per-
euniol. Leaves radicul. Flowcrs in adense head, intermiaed with hracts,
on a leafless scapo.

The genus is limited to a single species eudemio in Australis. n. Brorrn appears to me
so have been quite right in including it in Gocdenonicae, ol which it has tbe remarkable
indusium. lt hes since been raised into an independcnt Order, on account ol the irce orary,
regular tlowers, and ernlhuminons seed, and has even been removed sar away ironr Goodeao·
sica to the neighbourhood ol Plumbapineoe. 'l'be ovary and fruit are, however, so com·
plclsly enclosed in the constrictcd calyx-tube as lo be really less inec than in totalis rala-
penna, tbe exceptionally regular llowers arc hut little rnorc so than in Diarparie, and in
somer ies cl Scaevola, especially S. spissescere, l hare touud the albumen much reduced.
