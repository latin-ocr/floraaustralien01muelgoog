Α genua comprising nearly the wbole Order, aad entirely Australisn, with the exception
of one speeies extending into tropienl Asia, aad another East Indian speeies not yet identified
with certainty with any Australisn one. 'l'he majority of the speeies form s rosette or
spreading taft of radient leaves, from the midst of wbieb springs the serape. Sometimes the
following year tbe new leaves arrd seape are elose upon the old ones, forming a dense, tulled
siocli, the bases of the leaves sometimes assuming a bnlbous appearaneey in others, one or tivo
short stema are formed above the old luft, eaoh erowned bys aew rosette and seapeand some·
times several successive tufts of leaves, separated by short stems or brunebes, may be observed ;
these are termed proliferoas stems or branobse, and occasionally emit adventitions roots
from several of tbe lower tufts. In a ferr species the leaves are ell, or only the small npper
ones, in almost regular wborls ; and in a few others tbey are alternate or seattered without
forming tufts. The inlloreseeneein different speeies shows every gradation, from the simple
recense or raeeme-lilie paniole to the eorynrb orto the dichotomous cyrne nien sessile or
pedieellate flowers in the forks. The precise form of the corolla, the directiones its lobes
in the erpanded doner, und the small seales or glandular appendsges in the tbrost or at the
base of the labellum may be constant in nrany eume, end might serve for good speeitle eba-
raelers; but these parts are so delieate that there is great uncertainty in deseribing them
from dried specimens. Different botanists have described thera differently in tbe same
speeies, and l bave myself found considerable diserepsneies in this respect in different
floweru even of the same specimens3 tbe ebaraeters founded on tbern must therefore not be
absolutely relied on. 'fbe oolour ot the fener is also said to be eonstasd in sonre speeies,
nnd has been made use of as a speoifie ebsraeter sinee the time of Brown; but it appears to
be variable in other speeies, and in most esses it is either unknown, or only pren in vagae
