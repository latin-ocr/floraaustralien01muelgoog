lt. Brown had already indicated that the four species be proposed vvere very closely oon-
nected with esch other, and F. Mueller appears οο have been quite right in nniting them.
The broad-lervel tornis, D. undulata ond D. rosunofforsh‚run so closely into each other, in
the numerous spccimcns before me, ns to he inseperable even aa verieties. D. ooclisols'a and
D. purpureo, also insepnreble lrom esch other, have smaller, mamertine, more oval leaves,
more narrovved st the base and sometimes almost ohovateeuneate, and generally a looser
irrtlorescenoe and shorter indumentum on the tlovrers, especially in the southern specimem,
but many specimens pass into the bmarlleaved torm. Both appear to be very abundant in
the Blae Mounteins. Sieber’s 11227 belongs to the oralleaved variety. Some ottho
northern speoimsns hare tha leaves almost ovate-lanoeolate.

14. D. lanceolata, A. euos.,· DC. Prod. vii. 503. An ereot or dil·
fuse undershrub or sbrnb nearly allied to D. rosmarinisolio, but approeehing
in some respecta to D. Broronii. Branohes usually sulcate, scabrone or
stellam-boiry. Leaves ellipticnl oblong·lineer or lanceolata, entire or with a
few leeth, mostly lerger and less revolute than in D. rosmariuijolio, much
narrower then in D. Brotonis', glabrous bnt seobrous ebore when 01111 grown,
slightly hoery-tomentose underneath. Peduneles in the upper axils solitory
or olustered, mostly longer than the floral leaves, l· or semilowered. Bmets
very small. Flowera elothed with a loose stellete tomentum intermixed with
longer plumoso heim. calyx-leeth very small, almost concealed in the in-
dumentum. Corolls about 1 in. long. Ovary l-celled, with 1 ereot narrow
