Calyx divided to the base or below the middle into ὅ narrow segments, all
equal or nearly so. Corolia tubular at the base, the upper lip broad, entire,
notehed or shortly etobsd, the lower one spreeding‚ a-lobed. Stamens 4, in
pairs; anthera 2-celled¹ with the cells quite separate and somewhat stipitate.
Style delleeted at the summit, with 2 short flat stigmatis lobes, scarcely
winged at the bend. Capsule broadly ovoid or oblong, usually obtuse, open·
ing in 4 valvas, leaving lhe dissepiment entire at least at thebeae, bearing
the placentas on its faces, thus forming as it were two wings to the undivided
placental column. Sceds numerous, small, striate and transversely reticulate.
-llcrbs usually growing in marshes or shallow water, glabrous or slightly
pubescant, usually scented and marked with pellueid dots. Leaves opposite
or whorled, toothed or deeply cut, the submerged oues in some speeies divided
into numerous capillary segmenta. Flowers solitary in the axile, the upper ones
sometimes forming e termine] maenae. Bracteoles linear, close under the calyx.
