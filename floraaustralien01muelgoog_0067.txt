mens free. Ovary interior (at least as to tbe eorolla), except the oonvex
summit more or less prominent within the corolla, more or less 2·eelled‚ the

undivlded. Iudusium cup-sbaped, enclosing the truncate or divaricately
a-lobed stigma. Capsule opening in 2 valvas parallel to the dissepiment or
surely splitting into evolvas. Seeds usually flat, with a callous or vinged
margin, rarely thicker, aud not bordered. Embryo usually about half as
long as the albumen or obortam-Herm undershrubs or rarsly abraba.
Leaves alternate or rarlical. Peduueles either axillary or iu terminat raoemea
