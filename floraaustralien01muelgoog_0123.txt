elothed with a close white cottony wool. Leares ohovate to oblong‚ obtuse,
entire, uarrowed into a petiole, thick and sest, 1 to 2 in. long or the lower
ones larger on long petiolas. Flowers pellea, clustered along the rhachis ol
long interrupted lealleas and cottony terrninal spikes or the uppermost soli·
tary, all sessile or nearly so. Bracts very small, obtuse. Calyx ia some
specimens densely cottony, iu others hirsute with purplish hairs; lobes linear,

shorter than the tube. Corolia 4 to 5 lines long, cottouyor hirsute outside.
Fruit orate, listened, about 2} lines long, soltly tomentose, erowssed hythe
calyx-lobes, with a hard endooarp (the pericarp separating from the ealyx-
tube i). Seed ilat, filling the easily ol the fruit-Scaeae Mwordtii, De
