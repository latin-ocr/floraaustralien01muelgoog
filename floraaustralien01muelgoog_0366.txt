Stems shrnbby at the base, ercet nnd slender (or the bmncbes rarely elon-
gated nnd twining P), minutely pubescent as well as the infleresceace and
young foliage. Leaves very nonen-linear, flat or with recurred margins,
contracted into a very short petiole, 3 to 5 in. long. Flowers not numemus
in¹ shortly pedunculate interpetiolar rnnbels. Sepals almost acute, about}
line long. Corollntube rather shorter than the calyx, brocdly cam anulate;
lobes ovate-lanceolam, rather longer than the tube, bearded inside low the
middle as well as the tube, and the throat almost closed with tulta of hairs
alterneting with the lobes, but no sceles. Corona none except obscure protube-
ranocs at the base of the gynosteginm. Stigma narrem-conical, longer than
the anthera-seem. Fl. vit. t. 31.

Also in the riji lslands, it my identificatioo is correct. Ssemana's specimens bave tbe
leaves aot so long, and the peduncles shorter, or the nmbels almost sessile. ‘lhe corollas
aro also described ns more rotate and less bairy incide, but the Australian and ll'iji plenta are
otherwise exeeediugly similar. Our specimens from ffiji have no perfect corollas.

Sncr. 111. constemus-corolla without scales in the throat. Corona
consisting ol 5 small glande or protuberanccs at the base ol the gynostegium.
Leones with small glands at the base ol the lamina on the upper side.

b. G. micndenla, Bentt. A rather slender but tall twiner, minutely
but sottly pubescent. Leuves obovateoblong or ellipticel, abruptly and
shortly acuminata, mostly rounded at the base, becoming glabrous above
when tull grown, with 2 or 3 minuto glande on the uppcr suriaco imme·
diately above the petiole, l to lh in. long. Umbcls small, sometimes

shortly ‹leveloped into cymes, on short interpetiolnr peduncles, solitary or
rarely opposite and axillary. Calyx-scgments ovate, obtuse, not ξ line long.
(lorello-tube broad, as long ss the calyx, slightly contractcd at the throut but
without scales or hairs insidc; lobes short, obtuse. Corona ol 5 scarcely
nominent small glande or protuberances at the base of the gynostegium.

Corolla rotate, deeply divided into 5 acuminate lobes, valvate in the bud.
Corona an undulete ring round the gynostsgium below the anthers, and more
prominent between the anthers than opposite to them. Anthers without
terminul mernbmnes. Pollen·masses 2 to each anther, ovoid‚ erect‚ laterally
attached below the middle. Stigms short, obtuse—Herbs, with tuberous

rhiyoyncs and creet stems. Leaves lineer or none. Flowers in sessile

'l'he genus is limited to Aristralim bot is nearly ellied to the Asiatic Petitarum. lt was
