Calyx vlivivled to the base into 6 distinct sepals‚ the onter one mach broavler
than the others. Corolia tnbnlar at the base, the appar lip creet or spread·
ing, notchcd or a-loben, the lower lip spreading, 3-loned, or sometimes the
5 lobes nearly equal. Stamens 4, in pairs, the authors all perfect, 2-celled,
the cells contignons. Style dilated aa the summit, concave or slightly alobal.
Capsnle opening loculicidally in 2 often bifid volves or in 4 valvas, leaving
the placentas on afree cerrtral column or dissepirncnt. Seeds numerous,
nsnally striate aad transverscly reticulate.-Glabrons or rarely pubescant

specics the submerged ones ont into numerous capillary segmenta. Flowers
