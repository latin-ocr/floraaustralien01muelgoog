Authers 2·oelled, opening at the top by 2 separate pores or ohlong slits or
rarely by 2 slits extending their whole length. Hypogynous dislr very small
or none. Ovary having usually as many eells as lobes of the corolla, rarely
(in genera not Australian) apparently twice as many or reduced to 3 or 2,
with l or several ovules in each cell, the placentas attached to the axis.
Fruit either capsular ot suoculent aad indehiscent. Seeds very small, with
a fleshy albumen, the embryo straight, often small-Shruhs, sometimes very
low creeping and almost herbaceous, more frequently ereet aud hushy or
growing up into small trees, very rnrely, in speeies not Australian‚ true herhs.
Leaves entire or toothed, undivided, usually alternate, penninerred or 3-nerved.
Flowers either axillury aad solitery, or in short clusters or heuds, or forming
terminal raeemes eurymbs blusters or heads.

'lhislarge Order is widely spread over the whole world, especially in the temperate arrd
eolder regions, but not unoommon also in hilly districts within the tropica. ln Australis,
however, it is very much restricted both in area aud in numbers, being only known in 'Pas-
mania and in the mountaina of Victoria aud New England. The three Australiau genera
belong ιο three of the great suborders (or, according tn some, distinet Orders) into which
Bricaceoe hara been divided. One, thrteiria, is cadumim another, Perrettya‚ extends
to Neve Zealand and South Ameriam the third, Gaultteria, has a wide range over thehilly
regienses Asia and Ameriae
