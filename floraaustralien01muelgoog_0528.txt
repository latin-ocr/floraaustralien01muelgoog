Calyx ‹lecply divided intoh or rarely 5 segments. Corolia either rotate or
with a distinct tube arrd spreading limb; lobes 4 or very rarely 5, imbricato
in the bnd, the laterai ones or one ol them outside. Stamene 2, inserted in
the tube and asserted horn it; anthera with confluent cells, without points
or atvrrs. Styla hlilorm, with an undivided somcwhat capitote stigma. t'ap
sule compressed or turgid, sarrowed on each side, either septicidnlly dehiscent
with the placentne separating or loculicidslly dehiscent aith the valvas
remaining adherent to the nrnlivided placental column, or separating from it
and septicidally bifid. ’ Seeds ovate or orbicular, compressod, attached hythe
