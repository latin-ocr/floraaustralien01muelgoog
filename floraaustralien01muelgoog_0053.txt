l. 1¹.bellt‹tifetta,Hoot.s. Ie. Pl. t. 851 and Fr. Tarm. i. 236. Quite

glabrous. Stoek deusely tusted. Leaves all radicat, rosulate-obovate or
oblong-spatlrulate, very obtuse, rather tbielr, rarely above l in. long. Scapes
slender, 3 to 5 iu. long, usually with 2 or 3 small, linear bracts under the
flower. Calyx about 2 liues long, the linear-oblong lobes about as long as
the globular tube. Corolia-tube about 1 line long, the lobes rather longer,
obovate, 2 rather larger than the others, the throat olten with small, glandu-
lar appendages. stigma-lobes broad, shortly exeeeding the anthera, which
were not quite perfectio the florver examined, probablya partially female
one. Capsule broadly ovoid, about 3 lines long.

Onnaa LXIV. GOODENOVIEAE.

Calyx-tube adnate to the ovary or rarely lree, tlte limbos 5 persistent lobes,
sometimes very small, or united in a ring, or quite obsolete. Corolia irre-
gular or rarely regular, with blobes, valvnte in the bud, their margins
usually induplioate aud expauding into glabrous roinys as the flower opens.
Stamens 5, alternate with the lobes of the corolla aud inserted at the jauc-
tion of the corolla-tube with the ovary or very rarely shortly aduate to the
corolla-tube; anthera lealled, the cells parallel, opening longitudinally, sree
or united in a ring round the style. Ovary wholly or artially inferior, at
least as to tbe corolla, or rarely free within the corolla-tube, l· or 2-celled ;
ovules l, 2 or more iu each cell, ereet or ascending (except in Catoaperma).
Style simple and uudivided (except in Oolopyne), witha eup-shaped or 2-
lipped dilatation‚ called indusium, at the top, euelosing the stigma. Fruit an
indehiseent aaut or drupe, or a capsule opening in tort valves or rarely
bursting irregularly or almost indehiseent. Seeds with a thiu or crustaceous
or thick and hard testa; embryo straight in the centre ol a someuhat tleshy
albumen, which is rarely deficient; radicle next the hilum-Herba under-
shrubs or rarely shrubs, the juice not milky. Leaves alternate or mdical,
very rarely irregularly opposite, entire, toothed or rarely pinnatilid. Flowers
hermaphroditae, axillary or iu terminal sapitas, racemes or penicles, tlte pn'·
mary inflorescence centripetal, the seeondnry usually cyrnose arrd dicho·
temous. Bracteoles on the l-llowered peduncles (when present) aud braets
at the forits ol the dichotomous cymes, opposite. Corolia yellow blue or

white, rarely red or purple.

The Order is almost exclusively Austrnlian, a very lew species only oi oue genus (scevola)
being lrrrowu from Nea Zealand, the Paeific islanda, aad the coasts ol tropieal and subtra-
pieal Africa, Asia, aad America, and oue ol another genus (Caloqyne), perhaps uot ditt'crcnt
from su Australian one, extending to the coast os Chiae It is, no doubt, allied to Carer-
penulam, but, besides the differenees iu the ovules, truit, and sceda, and tbe want ot the
milky juiceot that Order, Goodenoeieoe are rcadily known by the remarkable indusium,
which evidently, together with the peculiarsurrounding hairs os the style or ol the corolla,
acts a considerable part iu assisting the proper impregnation ol the stigma. The eon-
trivances by which this impregnation is impediti, retarded, or promoted, appear to be rery
different iu different genera, es, ior instance, in Goodenia, Leseteuauraa andDampiera,
aad are well wortby oi caretur observatias on tbe part ot botanists resident in Australis,
