nulls usually divaricata und ollen confluent. Capsule opening in 2 membru·
aroris entire valvas, parallel ho the broad thin dissepiment.

Lilu the majority ol Buprats'oleae, the species are chiefly abundant in marshes or rich
moisi soils. eud are more or less glsuduludotted. 'l'he principal genera are closely allied,
and osten distinguished chielly by characters derived trom the sternens, which are difficolt to
ascertain iu dried specimens owing to the delicacy ol the corollas, but said to he readily seen
iu living planta. l'. Mueller proposes the renuitiug several ol thern under the name ol
Lirrrleruin oroi Vandellia, bnt that would entail the regarding the whole subtribe as a gc·
ritis, ot which the present genera would be sectione. This would appear to nte to be morea

nunaunt than s real change, involving all the inconveniente ol u great addition to the syno-
nymy without any corresponding advantage. ‘
