Calyx about 2} lines long, deeply divided into lanceolate lobes. Corolla
dull purple, about 4 or 5 lines diameter, the lobes broad, obtuse, as long as
or longer than the tube, reflered when sullyo u, very pubesoent outside.
Filaments dilatcd and pubasoeut ut thebasa, andblosed over the ovary, then
filiiorm and recurved, rather shorter than the corolla. Capsulc enclosed iu
the persistent calyx, quite glabrous. Sccds usually very few, and sometimes
only a single one ripcning; testa reticulate, rugosc, slightly maiascus-a.
