(blichioa, F. Maeli.)

Sepals small. Corolia-tube short, bearded inside at the throat‚ otherwise
glabrous3 lobes long, linear, valsate in the bud, more or less bearded inside,
much revolute exposing the stamens. Filaments inserted in the throat; an·
thers exserted, linear, l-oelled, attached by the middle, nohering above the
middle in a noue round the style. Hypogyuous disk none or very obscure.
Osary boelled, with 1 ovule in each cell. Style filiform, longer than the
norolla-tube; stigma small. Fruit a drupe with a dry or soaroely pulpy me·
snoarp and a hard eudonem, with ὁ cells and soeds, or fener by abortion—
Leares flat nr ooneave. Floners small, 2 nr 3 together on a short axilla
pedunole, or solitary with a minute rudimeut of another. Braets few, small,
the subtending one slightly eularged and embraciug the base of the calyx as
well as the larger bracteoles.

'l'he genus ia limited to S.W. Australis. Itis nearly allied to Styptehia, with which F.
Mueller has recently united it (Fragm. ri. 80), but the mall honera gire it tha apest ot
bemnpnyoa, aud the exsaned nonnata anthera readily distinguish it from both.
