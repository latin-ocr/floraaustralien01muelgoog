ra. nore, a ar.

Corolla rotate, the lobes flat or with reflexed margins, salvate in the bnd.
Corona of ὅ rather thick lleshy segmento attached to the gynosteginm, hori·
zontally spreading or expanded into variously-sheped disks. Anthers terrai-
nated byn membrane; pollen-messes 2 to each anther, creet. Stigma obtuse
or scarcely prominent-Stema twining or trailing. leaves thick and lleshy
or in a ferr species not Australian membraneus. Flowers often lleshy or
waxy, in pedunculate interpetiolar simple umbels.

The genus is widely spread orer tropiral Asia, and more aparingly represented in Africa on

theone hand, and the Sonth Pacific lelands on tha other. Of the three Anstralian speeies,

one extends orer the Indian Archipelago to Sonth Chias, another isin the islanda of the
Sonth Paeihc, the third may be eudemio, although closely allied toa Pacilic laland one.

diameter, broadly 5-lobed, densely papillosc on the upper side, the margins

reenraed, the gynostegium spreading lilre a closely appressed star in the
oentre. Corona-segments forming the horizontal rays of the star, alternating
with the corolla-lobes, ovate-lanceolate, conver, shining above (rvrinkled in

drying), the margins revolute-Asclepion corrroso, Linn.; Bot. Mag. t. 7883
