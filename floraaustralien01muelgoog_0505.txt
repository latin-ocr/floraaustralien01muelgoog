Snaoanaa ΙΙ. Anrrsnnmmam.-Corolla olobed or t-lipped, imbricate
in the bnd, the upper lip or 2 upper lobes ontside. Inflaresoenee oentripetal
or, in genera not Australian‚ eompouod‚ the primary peduneles oentripetal
hut branching into centrifugal eymes.

ln the great majority ot genera the differenee in austivatioo benaa the antirrhinum
and Illiuunlls'deae is well marled and easily ascertained. lt is only in sonia ot the minute·
tlowered Limorelleae, and a very lew non-Aostmliau small genera ol Sibtherps'eae that tha
mstivation is nueertain and perhaps variable. Tha dehiseenee ol the capsule in Antirrhi-
nideae is very variable, and m every lew non-Australiau genera, the fruit is a berry.

Tarae Germaniam-Coro& tubular at the base, neither spnrred nor
gibbons. Stamene shorter than the corolla, aseending, didynamons or re·
‹lueed to two. Capsule opening in 2 orl valves or very rarely indehiseeut.

Stamens ull inserted in the tube and, in the Australian genera, entirely in·

or aad valvas, or 4-vulverl‚ or'septieidal with 2-fid vulves.

without bracteoles, the upper ones forming sometimes a terminal raeeme.
