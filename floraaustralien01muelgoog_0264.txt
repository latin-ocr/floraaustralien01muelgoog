corolla-tube cylindrical, entire or separating at the base or altogether into
distinct petel-claws; lobes 5, horizontally spreading, contorted in the bad.
Filaments free from the base or more or less adnate to the corolla, especially
towards the throat; anthera linear, attached at or above the middle, wholly
or partially included iu the tube. Hypogynous disk of 5 distinct scales,
usually as long as the ovary. Ovary 5-celled, with several usually numerous
ovules in each cell, ou a placenta attached to the axis. Style osten thickened
above the every, inserted in a shallow or deep and tubular depression oi the
ovary. Capsule loculicidally dehiscent-Erect struggling or virgate shrubs.
Leaves persistent. Flovvers almost sessile and solitary in the upper axils,
forming lealy heads or spikes or rarely more scattered along the brauehes.
Bracts very numerous, imbricata, eovering the very short peduncles and
calyx, passing gradually into the sepals and forming aa involucra round
them.

'l'he genus is limited to Australis. Itis very near Eponae, hut readily distinguished by

the more strictly hypocraterilorm corolla, with the ivnbrication oi the obes strictly eon·

is deep in t. pangens, and rather deep in t. (amantium aad h. citiarum, hut shallow in the
others, at least in the dowers examined but seems variable according to the stageot grossth

chiefly the upper ones that eularge, so that the seeds are usually (though not always) sil
